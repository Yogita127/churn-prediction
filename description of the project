In this project, We will use “Telco Customer Churn” dataset which is available on Kaggle. There are 20 features (independent variables) and 1 target (dependent) variable for 7043 
customers. Target variable indicates if a customer has left the company (i.e. churn=yes) within the last month. Since the target variable has two states (yes/no or 1/0), this is a binary classification problem.
The variables are: 'customerID', 'gender', 'SeniorCitizen', 'Partner', 'Dependents', 'tenure', 'PhoneService', 'MultipleLines', 'InternetService', 'OnlineSecurity', 'OnlineBackup', 'DeviceProtection', 'TechSupport', 'StreamingTV', 'StreamingMovies', 'Contract', 'PaperlessBilling', 'PaymentMethod', 'MonthlyCharges', 'TotalCharges', 'Churn'.At first glance, only customerID seems irrelevant to customer churn. Other variables may or may not have an effect on customer churn. We will figure out.
